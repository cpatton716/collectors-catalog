## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate (No Code Changes)
1. **Use Haiku for text lookups** - Save 60% on non-vision AI calls
2. **Extend cache TTL** - 7 days → 14 days for stable data
3. **Lazy load images** - Reduce bandwidth costs

### Short-Term
4. **Pre-populate top 5,000 comics** - One-time ~$100 cost, saves 30%+ ongoing
5. **Implement Redis caching** - Reduce DB calls by 50%+
6. **Add response compression** - Reduce bandwidth 60-70%

### Long-Term
7. **Train custom vision model** - Replace Claude Vision with cheaper custom model
8. **Build barcode database** - Reduce AI calls for known UPCs
9. **Negotiate enterprise rates** - At scale, negotiate with Anthropic/Clerk

## Break-Even Analysis

If we implement a premium tier at $5/month:

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Premium Users Needed |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Launch | $20 | 4 users |
| Early Growth | $75 | 15 users |
| Growth | $325 | 65 users |
| Scale | $1,500 | 300 users |

**Typical conversion rates for freemium:**
- Free → Premium: 2-5%

| Total Users | At 2% Conversion | At 5% Conversion |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1,000 | 20 premium ($100/mo) | 50 premium ($250/mo) |
| 5,000 | 100 premium ($500/mo) | 250 premium ($1,250/mo) |
| 10,000 | 200 premium ($1,000/mo) | 500 premium ($2,500/mo) |

**Break-even point: ~3,000-5,000 total users** (at 3-4% conversion)

---

## Biggest Cost Drivers

1. **Anthropic AI (40-60% of costs)** - Main variable cost
2. **Clerk Auth (at scale)** - $0.02/MAU adds up
3. **Everything else** - Relatively fixed, predictable

---

## Recommendations

### For Launch
- Stay on all free tiers
- Add Sentry (free) and PostHog (free)
- Budget: **$20-30/mo** (just Anthropic)

### For Growth
- Upgrade Supabase to Pro when needed
- Add Upstash Redis
- Implement cost optimizations
- Budget: **$200-400/mo**

### For Scale
- Negotiate enterprise rates
- Consider self-hosting some services
- Implement all cost optimizations
- Budget: **$1,000-2,000/mo**
