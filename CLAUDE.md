# Claude Code Instructions

## On Session Start

1. Check recent git commits and summarize where we left off last session (1-2 lines)
2. Show a brief summary of `BACKLOG.md` so we can decide what to work on
3. Show a brief summary of work completed in the previous session.

## Backlog Display Format

When displaying the backlog, always group items by status and priority:
1. Pending - High Priority
2. Pending - Medium Priority
3. Pending - Low Priority
4. Completed (with dates)

Show each group as a numbered list with titles only, no details.

## New Feature Inteview

2. always provide the full "Implementation Plan" before adding a new feature

## Design Standards
1. Always keep mobile responsiveness part of all design decisions
2. Ensure all design decisions are focused on a streamlined UX for the user
