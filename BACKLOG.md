**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Jan 26, 2026)
**File:** `src/app/api/quick-lookup/route.ts`

Added rate limiting (20 requests/min) to protect Anthropic API costs.

---

**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Jan 26, 2026)

## Design Review

### Unique Visual Identity
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Jan 23, 2026)

Implemented Lichtenstein pop-art design theme with distinct visual identity.

**Features Implemented:**
- Pop-art color palette with bold primary colors
- Comic-inspired halftone patterns and Ben-Day dots

- Custom card designs for comics
- Cohesive brand personality throughout UI

**Design Branches Created:**

### Color Palette Refinement
**Priority:** Low
**Status:** Pending (future consideration)

Current palette uses Yellow for branding + Red for accents. May revisit with a more dramatic "Red & Black Only" palette for a mature, classic comic feel (like Sin City).

**Option 1 - Red & Black Only (saved for future):**
- Keep cream background and black borders
- Use red as the ONLY accent color for all icons, buttons, badges
- Remove blue, green, orange, yellow from accent uses
- Very sophisticated, classic newspaper comics aesthetic

## Pre-Launch Checklist

### Set Up the Business
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Pending

Complete business formation and financial infrastructure before public launch.

**Why It's Important:**
- Marketplace handles money between users - higher liability risk
- Protects personal assets from potential lawsuits
- Required for professional ToS & Privacy Policy
- Enables proper Stripe setup with business verification

**Steps (in order):**

| Step | Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Form LLC** | 30 min + 1-7 days processing | ZenBusiness, LegalZoom, or state website ($50-500) |
| 2 | **Get EIN** | 10 min (instant) | IRS.gov - free, requires LLC first |
| 3 | **Open Business Bank Account** | 1-2 hours | Requires LLC docs + EIN, get business debit card |
| 4 | **Set Up Stripe** | 30 min | Use business name, EIN, bank account |
| 5 | **Update Payment Methods** | 30 min | Switch all services to company card |

**Step 4 - Stripe Configuration Details:**

Create these products in Stripe Dashboard → Products:

| Product | Price | Type | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Premium Monthly | $4.99/month | Recurring | 7-day free trial enabled |
| Premium Annual | $49.99/year | Recurring | 7-day free trial enabled |
| Scan Pack (10 scans) | $1.99 | One-time | For free users who hit limit |

Environment variables to add (`.env.local` AND Netlify):

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM_MONTHLY=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM_ANNUAL=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_SCAN_PACK=price_xxx
```

Configure webhook at `https://collectors-chest.com/api/webhooks/stripe` for events:
- `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`
- `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`

**Step 5 - Services to Update:**

| Anthropic | ~$0.015/scan | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) → Billing |

|------|------|--------|
| Free | $0 | 5K errors/mo |
| Team | $26/mo | 50K errors/mo |

**Action Required:**

- Issue descriptions/summaries
- Consistent data format across Marvel catalog

**Benefits:**

### Native App: Cover Image Search via Default Browser
**Priority:** Low
**Status:** Pending

When converting to native mobile apps (iOS/Android), the cover image search feature needs to open the device's default browser for Google Image searches instead of an in-app webview.

**Current Behavior (PWA/Web):**
- User taps "Search Google Images" button
- Opens Google in a new tab
- User must use native back arrow/gesture to return to app
- User pastes copied image URL

**Native App Requirements:**
- Open device's default browser (Safari on iOS, Chrome/default on Android)
- Maintain app state while user is in browser
- Handle return to app gracefully (deep link or app switcher)
- Consider clipboard monitoring to auto-detect copied image URLs (with permission)
- Alternative: In-app browser with "Copy URL" detection

**Platform-Specific Notes:**
- iOS: Use `SFSafariViewController` or `UIApplication.open()` for external browser
- Android: Use `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` or Chrome Custom Tabs
- React Native: `Linking.openURL()` or `react-native-inappbrowser`

**UX Considerations:**
- Clear instructions that user will leave the app temporarily
- "Paste URL" button should be prominent on return
- Consider toast/notification when URL is detected in clipboard
