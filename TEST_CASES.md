## Known Limitations

1. **eBay prices require title + issue** - Price lookup needs both fields; AI fallback used otherwise
2. **CSV import desktop only** - Better UX on larger screens for file management
3. **Guest scan limit** - Guests get 5 initial scans + 5 bonus scans (via email verification) = 10 total
4. **Email verification required for bonus** - Bonus scans require clicking verification link in email; not granted immediately
5. **One bonus claim per device** - IP tracking prevents multiple bonus claims from same device
6. **First lookups are slower** - Comics not in database require AI lookup (~1-2s); subsequent lookups are fast (~50ms)
7. **Database caching is shared** - All users benefit from lookups made by other users
8. **eBay may have no results** - Obscure comics may not have recent sales; AI fallback provides estimate
