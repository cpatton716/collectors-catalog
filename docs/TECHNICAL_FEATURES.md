## 1. AI Cover Recognition & Multi-Provider Fallback
Camera capture → image compression (400KB target) → Claude Vision (primary) → Gemini (fallback) → structured comic identification. Two independent AI calls: image analysis (12s timeout) + verification/enrichment (8s timeout). Per-call fallback logic, non-retryable error detection, cost tracking ($0.02-0.03/scan Anthropic, $0.004-0.006 Gemini).

**Session 31 additions — Slab detection AI calls:**
- `detectSlab()` — Quick binary classification: is this a slabbed comic? Returns `SlabDetectionResult` with confidence score
- `extractSlabDetails()` — Detailed extraction from slab label: cert number, grade, grading company, label color, title, issue, variant, key comments, art comments, barcode. Returns `SlabDetailExtractionResult`
- New prompts: `SLAB_DETECTION_PROMPT`, `SLAB_DETAIL_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`, `SLAB_COVER_HARVEST_ONLY_PROMPT`
- New AICallType values: `slabDetection`, `slabDetailExtraction`
- Updated barcode detection prompt for slabbed comics (reads barcode through slab case)

---

## 2. Real-Time Pricing Engine (eBay Browse API)
OAuth token management → keyword search builder → category fallback chain (Comics → Collectibles → All) → outlier filtering (remove top/bottom 10%) → Q1 conservative pricing (25th percentile instead of median for more buyer-friendly estimates, min 3 listings) → grade multiplier extrapolation (6 grades from single lookup). Redis cache: 12h for results, 1h for "no data."

**Session 31 improvements:**
- **Year disambiguation:** `buildSearchKeywords()` accepts optional `year` param to differentiate same-title reboots (e.g., "Amazing Spider-Man #1 1963" vs "Amazing Spider-Man #1 2022")
- **Irrelevant listing filtering:** `filterIrrelevantListings()` removes non-comic results (lots, sets, posters, reprints, etc.) before price calculation
- **Q1 pricing:** `filterOutliersAndCalculateMedian()` now uses Q1 (25th percentile) instead of median for more conservative, buyer-friendly estimates
- **Grade filtering for slabs:** When pricing slabbed comics, search includes grade in keywords and filters results to only matching grade

**Session 40b addition — On-demand FMV refresh per comic:** `POST /api/comics/[id]/refresh-value` runs eBay Browse lookup for a single owned comic (owner-auth gated) and persists the result to `price_data` + `average_price` on that comic row. Honors the same 12h Redis cache as `/api/ebay-prices`. UI wire-up: `ComicDetailModal` renders a blue "Look Up Market Value" CTA when `effectivePriceData?.estimatedValue` is falsy (e.g., buyer-side clones of manually-added comics where the seller never scanned), and a "Refresh value" link inside the value card once data exists. Result is applied optimistically via local state so the new value appears without a reload. Known limitation (BACKLOG): `MIN_LISTINGS_THRESHOLD = 3` at exact grade returns "No eBay sales data found" for rare keys at uncommon grades — grade-band fallback needed pre-launch.

**Key files:** `src/lib/ebayBrowse.ts`, `src/app/api/ebay-prices/route.ts`, `src/app/api/comics/[id]/refresh-value/route.ts`, `src/lib/gradePrice.ts`, `src/components/ComicDetailModal.tsx`

---

## 3. Cover Image Pipeline & Auto-Harvest
Four-source waterfall for finding covers: Community covers → eBay listing images → Open Library → Gemini validation. Community submission with auto-approve (single match) or admin queue (multi-match). Creator Credits awarded on approval.

**Auto-harvest from graded scans:** When scanning slabbed comics, the AI reports crop coordinates for the cover artwork visible through the slab. If harvestable (sharp, well-lit, minimal glare), the pipeline automatically crops the cover, converts to WebP, uploads to Supabase Storage, and submits to the community cover DB — zero user friction. Runs pre-response with a 2s timeout. Deduplication via partial unique index.

**Session 39 addition — Aspect-ratio guard:** `src/lib/coverCropValidator.ts` rejects AI-returned crop coordinates outside the comic-book aspect range (0.55-0.85 w/h). Runs at the top of `harvestCoverFromScan` so out-of-range crops don't pollute the cover cache. 16 unit tests.

**Key files:** `src/lib/coverValidation.ts`, `src/lib/coverImageDb.ts`, `src/lib/coverHarvest.ts`, `src/lib/coverCropValidator.ts`, `src/app/api/cover-images/route.ts`

---

## 3b. Cover-Image Preservation Rule (durable invariant)

A small but load-bearing rule, codified in Session 45b after a Key Hunt regression where a user-snapped cover was being silently replaced by an eBay placeholder during Refresh / New Grade.

- **The user's per-instance cover lives in `comics.cover_image_url`.** It is the photo they took (or the cover they curated) for *their* copy of the book and is treated as user content.
- **Only `updateComic()` in `src/lib/db.ts` writes that column,** and it is only called from the collection-edit flow. No scan, no lookup, no cron, no admin tool writes `comics.cover_image_url` outside that one path.
- **API routes that fetch external covers** (eBay listing images, the cover harvest pipeline, slab cover-only harvest, etc.) write to `comic_metadata.cover_image_url` — the shared catalog cache — never the user's `comics` row.
- **Refresh / New Grade flows in Key Hunt** thread the existing `coverImageUrl` through the lookup so a fresh call that returns no listings (and therefore no eBay image) doesn't cause the UI to fall back to a placeholder.

**This rule is durable.** Any new code path that touches `coverImageUrl` — new scan modes, sync jobs, repair tools, future native-app flows — must respect the boundary: scrape/harvest results land in `comic_metadata`, the user's photo stays put in `comics`.

**Key files:** `src/lib/db.ts` (`updateComic()` — sole writer of `comics.cover_image_url`), `src/app/key-hunt/page.tsx` (`setPendingComic` cover passthrough), `src/lib/coverImageDb.ts` (`comic_metadata` writers).

---

## 3c. Cover Image Persistence Pipeline (Session 46, May 9, 2026)

User-snapped photos taken via the FAB scan flow are now uploaded to a dedicated Supabase Storage bucket and persisted as a public URL on the `comics` row instead of being embedded as a `data:` URI. Required because the existing `cover_image_url` sanitizer (`src/lib/coverImageUrlSanitizer.ts`) hard-rejects all `data:` URIs to protect downstream consumers (CSV exports, Stripe product image URL caps, marketplace listing payloads).

**Pipeline:**
- Camera capture → in-memory `data:` URI for instant preview → on save, client helper `uploadCoverImage()` converts data URI → `Blob` → multipart `POST /api/comics/upload-cover` (Clerk-authed) → returns the public Supabase URL → that URL is what gets written to `comics.cover_image_url` via the normal `addComic()` path.
- `scan/page.tsx` `handleSave()` calls the helper before the DB write **for signed-in users only**. Guests bypass entirely (their collections live in localStorage where the data URI is fine).
- **Graceful degradation:** if the upload fails (network, bucket misconfig, oversize), the helper resolves to `""` and the save still succeeds — the comic just renders the placeholder cover instead of blocking the user.

**Storage configuration (migration `20260509_comic_covers_bucket.sql`):**
- Bucket name: `comic-covers`
- Public read (so URLs work in `<img>` tags, CSVs, Stripe payloads without signed URLs)
- 10MB file size cap (matches the analyze-route image cap)
- Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`
- RLS: authenticated users can `INSERT`; anyone can `SELECT`

**Boundary respected:** This is a write to `comics.cover_image_url` — Cover-Image Preservation Rule (3b) still holds. The user's photo lands in `comics`, not in `comic_metadata`. External harvest pipelines continue to write to `comic_metadata` only.

**Key files:** `src/app/api/comics/upload-cover/route.ts`, `src/lib/uploadCoverImage.ts`, `src/app/scan/page.tsx` (`handleSave()`), `supabase/migrations/20260509_comic_covers_bucket.sql`

---

## 4. Multi-Layer Caching Architecture
Redis (backend): eBay prices (12h), metadata (7d), AI analysis (30d), barcodes (6mo), certs (1yr). localStorage (frontend): offline lookups (7d, 30 items LRU), scan history, guest collection. Image hash cache prevents re-analyzing identical photos.

**Two distinct caching strategies for scans:**
- **Cert-level cache** (`cache:cert:{company}-{certNumber}`, 1yr TTL) — Stores the full cert lookup response. Keyed by cert number, so only helps if the exact same physical book is scanned again (rare in production).
- **Issue-level cache** (`cache:comic:{title}|{issueNumber}`, 7d TTL + permanent Supabase fallback) — Stores shared metadata: title, publisher, year, creators, keyInfo, coverImageUrl. Keyed by title+issue, so ALL copies of the same comic share this cache. This is where the real cost savings happen — the first scan of any ASM #300 populates this cache, and every subsequent ASM #300 scan (different cert, different user) skips expensive AI calls.

**End-of-route save:** Every successful scan writes issue-level metadata to both Redis (7d) and Supabase `comic_metadata` table (permanent) in parallel. This is the mechanism that connects cert lookups, AI results, and all enrichment to the shared issue-level cache.

**Key files:** `src/lib/cache.ts`, `src/lib/metadataCache.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts`, `src/lib/offlineCache.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`

---

## 5. Scan Quota & Reservation System
Guest: 5 scans (client-side + server header validation, +5 via email capture). Free: 10/month (atomic `reserveScanSlot()` with conditional UPDATE). Premium: unlimited. Purchased 10-packs ($1.99, never expire). Scan slot released on AI failure. Monthly auto-reset on 1st.

**Session 38 additions:**
- 10MB image upload cap via `src/lib/uploadLimits.ts` (`MAX_IMAGE_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `assertImageSize()`, `base64DecodedByteLength()`). Returns HTTP 413 on oversize. Shared by `/api/analyze` and `/api/messages/upload-image`. Client-side pre-validation in `ImageUpload.tsx` and `MessageComposer.tsx`.
- Scan-slot reservation leak fix: 413 (too large) and 400 (no image) error branches now release the reserved slot so users aren't billed a scan for a malformed request.

**Session 39 addition — hCaptcha Guest Scan Protection:** Invisible hCaptcha gates guest scans **4 and 5 only** (the last two free scans before the limit). Client via `@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha` with floating badge (`src/components/GuestCaptcha.tsx`), server helper at `src/lib/hcaptcha.ts` with 5s siteverify timeout and dev/prod key swap. Env vars: `HCAPTCHA_SECRET` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`.

**Key files:** `src/lib/subscription.ts`, `src/lib/uploadLimits.ts`, `src/lib/hcaptcha.ts`, `src/hooks/useGuestScans.ts`, `src/components/GuestCaptcha.tsx`, `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`

---

## 6. Subscription & Trial Lifecycle
Three paths: 7-day direct trial (no Stripe, DB-only) → 30-day promo trial (QR code → localStorage flag → Stripe subscription with `trial_period_days: 30`) → paid subscription ($4.99/mo or $49.99/yr). Webhook-driven state machine: created → active/trialing → past_due → canceled → downgrade. Idempotent webhook processing via event ID cache.

**Key files:** `src/lib/subscription.ts`, `src/app/api/billing/`, `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `src/lib/promoTrial.ts`

---

## 7. CGC/CBCS/PGX Certificate Verification
HTML scraping of grading company websites → structured data extraction (grade, page quality, signatures, label type, grader notes) → 1-year Redis cache keyed by cert number. Auto-detection of grading company from cert number format. Feeds into pricing, cover harvesting, and cert-first scan pipelines. Cert data also flows into the issue-level cache (see Feature 4) at end-of-route, so the first cert lookup for any issue benefits all future scans of that same issue.

**Known issue (Apr 2026):** CGC's website is blocking server-side lookups with Cloudflare bot protection (HTTP 403). CBCS and PGX are unaffected. ZenRows API (`mode=auto&wait=5000`) validated as mitigation — pending partner cost review ($49/mo for ~10K lookups). See BACKLOG.md for details.

**Session 31 additions:**
- `src/lib/certHelpers.ts` — `normalizeGradingCompany()` standardizes company names, `parseKeyComments()` / `mergeKeyComments()` combine AI-detected and cert-provider key comments, `parseArtComments()` extracts art-related notes
- Cert lookup integrated into cert-first pipeline Phase 3 for automatic verification during slab scans

**Key files:** `src/lib/certLookup.ts`, `src/lib/certHelpers.ts`, `src/app/api/cert-lookup/route.ts`

---

## 8. Barcode Detection & Catalog System
AI extracts 12-17 digit UPC → parsed into prefix/item/check/addon components → variant extracted from digits 16-17 → crowd-sourced `barcode_catalog` lookup → low-confidence entries queued for admin review in `admin_barcode_reviews`. Variant **name** resolution (turning the addon digits into a human-readable label like "Cover G") is delegated to the Variant Name Resolver — see Feature 8c.

**Session 45b (May 6, 2026) — Comic Vine integration retired.** The `/api/quick-lookup` route (Comic Vine barcode-fallback), the `COMIC_VINE_API_KEY` env var, the "Quick Lookup" PWA shortcut in `manifest.json`, and the service-worker cache entry for `/api/quick-lookup` were all removed in commit `69c186b` (~250 lines deleted). Comic Vine's API was unreliable for new releases and the curated key DB + crowd-sourced `barcode_catalog` cover the same gap with better data quality. Crowd-sourced barcode catalog is now the only post-AI fallback path.

**Key files:** `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts` (barcode catalog functions)

---

## 8b. Cert-First Scan Pipeline (Slabbed Comics)
Dedicated scan pipeline for slabbed/graded comics that bypasses standard cover recognition. Triggered when slab detection AI call returns positive. Five-phase pipeline:

- **Phase 1 — Slab Detection:** `executeSlabDetection()` with Gemini → Anthropic fallback. Quick binary: is this a slab?
- **Phase 2 — Slab Detail Extraction:** `executeSlabDetailExtraction()` reads cert number, grade, grading company, label color (blue/yellow/green/etc.), title, issue, variant, key comments, art comments from the slab label photo
- **Phase 3 — Cert Lookup:** If cert number found, scrapes CGC/CBCS/PGX for verification. `mergeKeyComments()` combines AI-detected comments with cert provider data. `normalizeGradingCompany()` standardizes company names
- **Phase 4 — eBay Pricing:** Grade-specific search with year disambiguation. `filterIrrelevantListings()` removes non-comic results. Q1 conservative pricing. Grade included in search keywords for slabbed results
- **Phase 4.5 — Metadata Cache Gate:** Checks issue-level cache (Redis → Supabase) for creators. If all 3 present (writer, coverArtist, interiorArtist), skips Phase 5 AI call. This is the key cost optimization — after the first scan of any issue, subsequent scans skip the ~0.5¢ AI call
- **Phase 5/5.5 — Focused AI / Cover Harvest:** Phase 5 extracts creators + barcode via AI (only if cache miss). Phase 5.5 runs cover harvest only (when cache hit). End-of-route save persists all data to issue-level cache for future scans. Analytics logged with `scan_path: 'cert-first'` and `barcode_extracted` fields

**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20260405_cert_first_analytics.sql` — adds `scan_path` and `barcode_extracted` columns to `scan_analytics`

**Key files:** `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` (Phases 1-5.5), `src/lib/aiProvider.ts`, `src/lib/certHelpers.ts`, `src/lib/providers/anthropic.ts`, `src/lib/providers/gemini.ts`, `src/lib/metadataCache.ts`, `src/lib/analyticsServer.ts`

---

## 8c. Variant Name Resolver (Session 46, May 9, 2026)

Three-tier resolver that turns a parsed barcode into a human-readable variant label (e.g., "Cover G", "Virgin Variant", "1:25 Incentive"). Lives in `src/lib/variantResolver.ts` and is wired into `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` immediately after `parseBarcode()` (~line 730).

**Design principle:** The barcode signal trumps any AI cover-derived hint. Two physically different variant editions can share identical cover artwork (cover-art-equal but trade-dress-different printings) — the addon supplement digits are the only authoritative discriminator, so the resolver intentionally ignores AI cover guesses when a barcode is present.

**Resolution tiers:**
- **Tier 1 — Catalog lookup.** `lookupApprovedVariantName()` queries `barcode_catalog` for a community-approved entry matching the prefix/item/addon. Source = `'catalog'`.
- **Tier 2 — Focused AI enrichment.** `enrichVariantNameFromAI()` makes a narrow Claude Haiku call (`MODEL_LIGHTWEIGHT`, ~$0.0008/call) using the cover image + parsed barcode to suggest a variant label. Source = `'ai'`.
- **Tier 3 — Deterministic addon fallback.** Pure mapping from addon digits to a generic label (e.g., addon `"71"` → `"Cover G"`). Source = `'addon'`. This always returns *something* when the barcode parsed cleanly.

**Dependency injection.** `resolveVariant()` takes `{ catalog: CatalogLookup, enricher: VariantEnricher }` so the route can swap in the production Supabase + Anthropic implementations while the unit tests inject in-memory fakes. 21 unit tests in `src/lib/__tests__/variantResolver.test.ts` cover tier ordering, short-circuit behavior, missing-input fallthrough, and the addon → label mapping table.

**Schema additions to `barcode_catalog`:**
- `variant_name TEXT` — the resolved label
- `variant_name_source TEXT` — `'catalog' | 'ai' | 'addon'`
- `variant_name_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'` — community-submitted variant names require admin approval before they're surfaced by Tier 1 lookups (prevents poisoning the shared catalog from a single low-confidence scan)

**UI:** `ComicDetailsForm.tsx` renders a "🔍 Detected from barcode/AI/addon code…" hint above the variant field with source-aware copy so the user can see why the form pre-filled the way it did.

**⚠️ Production caveat (known gap, top-priority for next session).** The resolver requires the AI to extract a full **17-digit** barcode (12-digit main UPC + 5-digit addon supplement) so the addon digits are available. In production scans the AI consistently captures only the 12-digit main UPC and misses the 5-digit add-on. Net effect: Tier 1 mostly hits only for entries seeded by other paths, and Tiers 2 + 3 don't fire at all in production today because the addon is empty. Tracked in BACKLOG as **"Variant Detection — Two-Pass High-Res Barcode OCR (Option C3)"** — a second targeted OCR pass on a high-resolution crop of the barcode region to recover the missing addon digits.

**Key files:** `src/lib/variantResolver.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/variantResolver.test.ts`, `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` (resolver wiring after `parseBarcode`), `src/components/ComicDetailsForm.tsx` (variant hint UI), `barcode_catalog` migration adding `variant_name` / `variant_name_source` / `variant_name_status`

---

## 9. Collection Entry Flows (4 paths)
- **Camera scan**: AI analysis → review/edit → save
- **Manual entry**: Form → optional metadata enrichment via Claude → save
- **CSV import**: Parse → per-row `/api/import-lookup` (cache-first, AI fallback) → bulk insert
- **Key Hunt**: Cover scan or manual → grade select → price lookup → optional "Add to Collection"

**Key files:** `src/app/scan/page.tsx`, `src/components/ComicDetailsForm.tsx`, `src/lib/csvHelpers.ts`, `src/app/api/import-lookup/route.ts`

---

## 10. Key Hunt (Convention Mode)

Mobile-first quick-lookup designed for the convention floor: scan a cover, get title + grade-aware price + key-issue context in 2-3 seconds, with graceful degradation when WiFi is unreliable. Updated extensively in Session 44 (May 5, 2026) and again in Session 45b (May 6, 2026 — history persistence + cover preservation).

### End-to-end flow

**Step 0 — Entry point.** User taps Key Hunt in the mobile nav (or opens `/key-hunt` directly), then selects "Scan Cover" (camera) or "Manual Entry" (autocomplete + form). Camera path described below; manual path skips Step 1 and goes straight to Step 2 with user-provided `{title, issueNumber}`.

**Step 1 — Cover image → AI vision (`POST /api/analyze`).**
- `src/app/key-hunt/page.tsx:153` POSTs `{image: base64, mediaType}` to `/api/analyze`
- `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` enforces auth + scan-limit (guest 5 / free 10/mo / premium ∞)
- Image goes to **Anthropic Claude vision** (Sonnet 4.5 primary; Gemini fallback on 5xx)
- Claude returns `{title, issueNumber, publisher, releaseYear, isSlabbed, grade?}`
- **`lookupKeyInfo()` consulted** with the recognized title+issue+year — pulls key facts from the curated `src/lib/keyComicsDatabase.ts` (945 entries as of Session 44) and attaches them to the response
- `recordScanAnalytics()` logs the scan to the `scan_analytics` table (cost ~$0.015, latency, AI calls, cache hit/miss, tier)
- Returns `ComicDetails` to the client

**Step 2 — Grade decision.**
- Slabbed: Claude detected a CGC/CBCS label and read the grade — client skips the picker and calls Step 3 with the detected grade
- Raw: client renders the 6-grade picker (9.8 / 9.4 / 8.0 / 6.0 / 4.0 / 2.0). User taps; client proceeds to Step 3.

**Step 3 — Price + key info lookup (`POST /api/con-mode-lookup`).**
- `src/app/api/con-mode-lookup/route.ts` runs three resolvers in order:

  **3a. Supabase cache hit** (`getComicMetadata` on `comic_metadata` table, ~50ms). If a row exists with eBay-sourced price data:
  - Pull cached `priceData`, `gradeEstimates`, `coverImageUrl`
  - **Curated DB beats stale cache (Session 44):** call `lookupKeyInfo()` against `keyComicsDatabase.ts`. If curated returns a hit, that wins over `dbResult.keyInfo`. Closes the long-tail bug where an earlier silent AI failure baked `key_info: []` into a row and returned empty key info forever.
  - Increment `comic_lookup_count` (powers future "top scans" gap analytics)
  - Return immediately — **no eBay call, no AI call, ~$0.00 cost**

  **3b. Cache miss → eBay Browse API + targeted AI.**
  - `searchActiveListings` queries eBay for current grade-aware listings
  - `convertBrowseToPriceData` produces `gradeEstimates`, `recentSales`, etc.
  - `runCoverPipeline` resolves the canonical cover URL with aspect-ratio guard (`coverCropValidator.ts` rejects bad crops — grade label strips, full slab regions)
  - **Curated DB beats AI (Session 44):** `lookupKeyInfo()` is called *before* `fetchKeyInfoFromAI()`. If the 945-entry curated DB has the answer, the AI call is skipped entirely. Saves cost on every scan of a popular key.
  - If curated DB doesn't have it: `fetchKeyInfoFromAI` runs (small ~$0.005 call). Failures are swallowed (returns `[]`).
  - `saveComicMetadata` persists the full result back to Supabase for next time
  - Return to client

  **3c. No eBay data → graceful fallback.** Returns `priceData: null` + `totalListings` + `ebaySearchQuery` so the client can render "X active listings on eBay" link instead of a price. **Curated key info still surfaces** (Session 44 — `lookupKeyInfo` consulted on this path too). **Session 45b — AI rescues curated misses on this path:** if `lookupKeyInfo()` returns nothing, the no-data branch now calls `fetchKeyInfoFromAI()` (mirroring 3b's behavior) so slabbed scans whose CGC cert title doesn't match a curated alias (e.g. "Ultimate Fallout: Spider-Man No More") still get the KEY ISSUE chip when there are zero eBay listings. Logged with the `[keyinfo-drift]` breadcrumb so the gap can be backfilled into `keyComicsDatabase.ts`.

**Step 4 — Client receives result, caches, renders.**
- `page.tsx:283` builds `LookupResult { title, issue, grade, price, keyInfo, coverImageUrl, source, ... }`
- **`cacheLookup()`** writes to `localStorage` keyed by `${title}-${years}|${issueNumber}|${grade}`. This is what makes re-scanning the same book at the con instant, even on bad WiFi.
- **`addToKeyHuntHistory()`** logs the scan to localStorage history (powers the "Recent Scans" view)
- `setResult(lookupResult)` + `setFlow("result")` triggers the result modal

**Step 5 — Result modal renders (`KeyHuntPriceResult.tsx`).**
- Cover thumbnail (top-left of gradient header) — **tappable → opens full-screen `CoverLightbox` for verification** (Session 44, addresses convention-floor variant verification need)
- Source badge: "eBay Data" / "Cached" / etc.
- Title + issue
- Grade badge
- **Yellow "KEY ISSUE" chips (Session 44)** — one chip per curated key fact (e.g. "Death of Elektra"). Renders between grade and price so collectors see context next to value. Hidden cleanly when `keyInfo` is empty.
- Raw / Slabbed price toggle (when both available)
- Big bold average price
- Recent sale (color-coded — red 20%+ above avg = market cooling, green 20%+ below = deal)
- "Recent Sales on eBay" deep link
- Add to Hunt List (Premium-gated, Capacitor-friendly)
- Add to Collection / New Lookup actions

### Convention-floor resilience matrix

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Online, fresh scan | Full Step 1-5 pipeline. Cache populated for next time. |
| Same book scanned again | localStorage cache hit, **instant return**, no network. "Cached" badge on result. |
| WiFi drops mid-fetch | `/api/con-mode-lookup` failure → automatic fallback to localStorage cache if available |
| Offline Mode toggled | Skips network entirely. localStorage only. Errors gracefully if not cached. |
| eBay returned but <3 listings at exact grade | Below-threshold display: "X active listings found" + eBay search link, key info still rendered |
| Anthropic API 5xx | `/api/analyze` falls back to Gemini for cover recognition automatically |
| Curated DB has the issue | Zero AI calls for key info on the entire flow. Faster + cheaper. |

### Curated key issue database

**`src/lib/keyComicsDatabase.ts`** — 945 hand-vetted canonical key issues (404 baseline + 541 added Session 44). Examples: Action #1 (first Superman), Detective #27 (first Batman), Detective #38 (first Robin), AF #15 (first Spider-Man), FF #1 (first Fantastic Four), FF #5 (first Doctor Doom), Hulk #181 (first Wolverine), GS X-Men #1, DD #181 (death of Elektra), ASM #300 (first Venom), ASM #129 (first Punisher), Batman Adventures #12 (first Harley Quinn), Walking Dead #1, NYX #3 (first X-23), Ultimate Fallout #4 (first Miles Morales), Captain America Comics #1, Marvel Comics #1, Whiz #2 (first Captain Marvel/Shazam), All-American #16 (first Alan Scott Green Lantern), Tales of Suspense #59 (first solo Cap modern), House of X #1 (Krakoa era), Mad #1, etc.

**Year convention: series-start year, NOT issue-publication year.** Detective Comics #38 (published 1940) uses `year: 1937` because Detective Comics started in 1937. ASM #700 (published 2012) uses `year: 1963` because the series started in 1963. The `resolveEntry()` function in `keyComicsDatabase.ts` rejects matches where `releaseYear < entry.year` (i.e., the comic claims to be from before the series started — wrong volume).

**Multi-volume disambiguation.** When a series has been relaunched (X-Men 1963 vs 1991 vs 2019, Iron Man volumes, Justice League #1 1987 vs 2011, etc.), every relaunch is a separate entry with its own `year`. The resolver picks by exact-year match, then by "most recent series start ≤ release year."

**Expansion path.** Curated DB is consulted by both `/api/analyze` (regular collection scans) and `/api/con-mode-lookup` (Key Hunt). Future entries will come from scan-data-driven gap mining (`npm run keys:gaps` tooling, planned post-launch — see BACKLOG "Expand Curated Key Info DB"). The DB also feeds the planned ETL for "Pre-populate Top Comics Cache" so seeded `comic_metadata` rows get correct `key_info` from day one.

### Session 45b (May 6, 2026) — History persistence + cover preservation

**Key info now persists in scan history.** The `KeyHuntHistoryEntry` interface in `src/lib/offlineCache.ts` was extended with `keyInfo` + `keyInfoMeta`, so curated key facts survive across the localStorage history (30-day TTL). Renders as a "Key" badge in `KeyHuntHistoryList` (one-line preview) and as full chips in `KeyHuntHistoryDetail`. Entries written before the May 6, 2026 deploy lack the field — natural attrition handles them as the 30-day TTL expires.

**Refresh / New Grade preserves the user's cover image.** When the user re-runs a lookup at a different grade or refreshes pricing on an existing result, the prior `coverImageUrl` is now threaded through `setPendingComic` so the lookup pipeline doesn't fall back to an eBay null/placeholder when the new query has no fresh listings. Fixes the visual regression where a user-photographed cover would suddenly switch to a generic image after Refresh.

**Add to Collection from history now passes `keyInfo`.** Previously the history → collection hand-off hardcoded `keyInfo: []`, dropping the curated facts. Now the persisted `keyInfo`/`keyInfoMeta` flow into the collection-entry form so the new `comics` row inherits the correct key context.

### Wishlist (Hunt List)

Premium feature. `key_hunt_lists` table tracks comics the user is hunting. Add-to-list button on result modal. Future enhancement: price-drop notifications when a hunted issue's eBay listing data hits a target.

## 11. Auction & Fixed-Price Marketplace
Two listing types: timed auction (1-14 days, proxy bidding) and fixed-price (30-day, accepts offers). Offer negotiation (max 3 rounds, 7-day expiry). Stripe Connect (Express) for seller payouts via destination charges. Transaction fees: 8% free / 5% premium with a **$0.75 minimum per sale** (seller-favorable `Math.floor` rounding above the floor). Cron-driven auction processing, listing expiration, and offer expiration.

**Transaction fee mechanics — snapshotted at listing time, not checkout time:**

The fee *rate* (5% or 8%) is determined by the seller's subscription tier *at the moment the listing is created*, not when the buyer pays. The minimum fee floor is a current constant, applied at checkout. Flow:

1. `createAuction` (`src/lib/auctionDb.ts:112-115`) and `createFixedPriceListing` (`src/lib/auctionDb.ts:207-210`) call `getTransactionFeePercent(sellerId)` at write time and persist the result to `auctions.platform_fee_percent` (5 for premium/trialing, 8 for free — see `src/lib/subscription.ts:655-663`).
2. `/api/checkout` reads the stored `platform_fee_percent` off the listing row (`src/app/api/checkout/route.ts:151-154`) — *not* the seller's current tier — and passes it through `calculateDestinationAmount(totalCents, feePercent)` (`src/lib/stripeConnect.ts`) to compute `sellerAmount = totalCents - max(MIN_PLATFORM_FEE_CENTS, floor(totalCents × feePercent / 100))`, capped so the seller payout can never go negative.
3. Stripe Checkout receives `payment_intent_data.transfer_data.destination` (the seller's Connect account ID) + `amount: sellerAmount`. No `application_fee_amount`, no `on_behalf_of`. No platform-fee configuration in the Stripe Dashboard — the split is 100% code-driven.

**Snapshot consequences (intentional, not a bug):**
- Premium seller lists, then cancels Premium → that listing still settles at 5% on purchase.
- Free seller lists, then upgrades to Premium → that listing still settles at 8% on purchase.
- Premium incentive is "list while you're Premium." If a future requirement is to recompute the rate at checkout, the change is `auctionDb.ts:115` and `:210` (drop the snapshot writes) plus `checkout/route.ts:151-154` (call `getTransactionFeePercent(listing.seller_id)` instead of reading the column).
- The $0.75 floor is **not** snapshotted — it's a const in `stripeConnect.ts` applied at checkout. Changing the floor affects all future settlements regardless of when the listing was created. If we ever need a snapshotted floor (so a price increase doesn't retroactively hit live listings), add `auctions.platform_fee_min_cents` and write it alongside `platform_fee_percent`.

**Stripe processing fee (~2.9% + $0.30) — paid by platform, not seller:**

The destination-charge model means the platform is the merchant of record. The buyer pays exactly the listed total (no surcharge added). Stripe deducts its processing fee from the platform's gross balance before the platform sees it; `transfer_data.amount` is the *seller's net*, deducted from the platform's available balance via Connect transfer.

Worked example — $100 sale, 8% (free seller):
- Buyer pays $100.00 flat.
- Stripe deducts ~$3.20 processing fee from gross → platform balance gains $96.80.
- Stripe transfers `sellerAmount = 100 - floor(100 × 0.08) = $92.00` to the seller's Connect account (8% percent-fee is well above the $0.75 floor, so floor doesn't apply).
- Platform net: $96.80 − $92.00 = **~$4.80**.
- Seller net: $92.00.

Same sale at 5% (premium seller): platform net **~$1.80**, seller net $95.00.

**$0.75 minimum platform fee floor (Session 42, Apr 27 2026):**

Below the percent-fee/Stripe-fee break-even point, every sale lost the platform money:
- Free tier (8%) break-even: $5.88. Premium (5%) break-even: $14.29.
- April 27 PROD validation showed a $2 test sale at 8% nets the platform −$0.20 (Stripe pulls the difference from future charges).

Floor sized to keep every sale gross-positive after Stripe's $0.30 + 2.9%. Above $9.38 (8%) and $15.00 (5%) the percent-fee already exceeds the floor, so the floor is invisible to typical comic sales. Below those thresholds, the seller pays $0.75 instead of the smaller percent-fee.

Worked example — $5 sale, 8% (free seller):
- Without floor: fee = $0.40, seller gets $4.60, platform nets $4.55 − $4.60 = **−$0.05**.
- With floor: fee = $0.75 (max of $0.40 and $0.75), seller gets $4.25, platform nets $4.55 − $4.25 = **$0.30**.

Worked example — $10 sale, 5% (premium seller):
- Without floor: fee = $0.50, seller gets $9.50, platform nets $9.41 − $9.50 = **−$0.09**.
- With floor: fee = $0.75, seller gets $9.25, platform nets $9.41 − $9.25 = **$0.16**.

Edge case — $0.50 sale: percent-fee would be $0.04, floor wants $0.75, but the cap at `totalCents` ensures the seller payout never goes negative. Platform takes the full $0.50, seller gets $0.00. Still a loss for the platform once Stripe fees apply, but only an issue if anyone lists at sub-floor prices (rare; we may add a listing-price floor as a follow-up if abuse appears).

**Session 36 changes (April 21, 2026):**
- **Stripe Connect fully enabled in both test and live mode.** Destination-charge fee splits validated end-to-end on localhost with test keys (5% premium tier and 8% free tier both verified). Live webhook endpoint now subscribed to `account.updated` (8 of 8 events configured).
- **RLS silent-failure fix:** `purchaseFixedPriceListing`, `placeBid`, and `processEndedAuctions` now use `supabaseAdmin` for writes. The regular client was silently failing under RLS — UI showed "Purchase Complete" while DB state remained unchanged. This caused stuck listings and unpaid winners.
- **PaymentButton rendered in detail modals:** Both `ListingDetailModal` and `AuctionDetailModal` now render `PaymentButton` when the viewer is the winner with `payment_status = "pending"`. Status checks normalized to cover both `sold` (Buy Now) and `ended` (auction) post-sale states.
- **Contextual notification copy:** `createNotification` accepts optional `{title, message}` overrides, so Buy Now purchases show Buy-Now-specific copy instead of inheriting the default auction-completion text.
- **Checkout success redirect** fixed from `/my-auctions` (seller view) to `/collection` (buyer view) — the buyer is the one completing the checkout.

**Session 37 changes (April 22, 2026):**
- **Flat $1 bid increment across all price tiers.** `getBidIncrement()` now returns $1 regardless of price (previously tiered $1/$5/$25). Simplifies bidding UX for casual users.
- **Buy It Now auto-hides when bid exceeds BIN price.** Prevents buyers paying more than current leading bid. Also hidden when viewer is the seller.
- **Idempotent `processEndedAuctions`:** conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE status='active'` with row-count check. Repeat cron calls on same auction are no-ops — no duplicate win/sold notifications or emails.
- **`getListingComicData` FK-qualified embed.** `sold_via_auction_id` FK added in the sold-tracking migration created a second auctions↔comics FK path, breaking unqualified PostgREST embeds with PGRST201. All embeds now use `comics!auctions_comic_id_fkey(...)`. This was silently dropping every outbid/auction_won/auction_sold email.
- **Awaited outbid email send** (`placeBid`) replaced fire-and-forget IIFE. Errors now logged; no more silent drops on serverless.
- **Auction buyer feedback eligibility** unlocks on `shipped_at` (matches `checkSaleFeedbackEligibility`). Previously buyer had to wait for `completed_at` or 7 days.
- **`submitFeedback` join fix:** all `.select` calls referenced non-existent `first_name, last_name` — changed to `display_name, username`. Insert was succeeding; the returning join was failing silently as "Failed to submit feedback."
- **New `/transactions` page + API** — tabbed buyer view (Wins / Purchases / Bids / Offers) with status pills (Awaiting Shipment / Shipped / Pending Payment / Paid).
- **Mark-as-shipped flow** — `POST /api/auctions/[id]/mark-shipped` sets `shipped_at`, clones the comic to the buyer's collection, fires shipped notification. Ownership transfer is gated on shipping, not on payment.
- **Auction-end email templates** — `auction_won`, `auction_sold`, `bid_auction_lost` (new types); all deliver correctly after FK fix.
- **Friendly DB error translation** — `placeBid` maps `valid_max_bid` and RLS errors to user-facing messages instead of surfacing raw Postgres strings.

**Session 38 changes (April 23, 2026) — Payment Deadline Enforcement:**
- **Checkout-time deadline guard** (`/api/checkout`): HTTP 400 "The payment window for this auction has expired" when `listing.paymentDeadline < now`. Previously buyers could pay days/weeks late — route only checked `paymentStatus !== "pending"`.
- **Live countdown timer on `/transactions`** via new `<PaymentDeadlineCountdown>` client component. Neutral >24h, orange ≤24h, red ≤6h, "Expired" at ≤0. Ticks every 60s, hydration-safe.
- **`sendPaymentReminders()` cron pass** fires at T-24h, idempotent via `payment_reminder_sent_at` column. `payment_reminder` NotificationType was already declared but never emitted.
- **`expireUnpaidAuctions()` cron pass** transitions stale auctions (`status='ended' AND payment_status='pending' AND payment_deadline < NOW()`) to `status='cancelled'`, sets `payment_expired_at`, emails both parties. Race-safe via `WHERE payment_expired_at IS NULL` + `.select()` row-count check.
- **`PAYMENT_WINDOW_HOURS` const cleanup** — four hardcoded `48`s replaced with `calculatePaymentDeadline()`.
- **New cron pipeline:** `processEndedAuctions → sendPaymentReminders → expireUnpaidAuctions → expireOffers → expireListings` (Session 39 adds `expireSecondChanceOffers`).
- **Migration:** `20260423_payment_reminder_tracking.sql` — adds `payment_reminder_sent_at`, `payment_expired_at` columns + partial index on `(payment_deadline) WHERE status='ended' AND payment_status='pending'`.

**Session 40 changes (April 23, 2026) — Marketplace PROD testing polish:**
- **Checkout image URL guard** (`/api/checkout`): `product_data.images[0]` is now only passed to Stripe when the cover URL is `http(s)://` AND ≤2048 chars. Previously a long Supabase signed-URL JWT query param or a base64 `data:` URI blew Stripe's 2048-char cap and surfaced as HTTP 500 `invalid_request_error`. Cosmetic-only on Stripe Checkout when omitted. Consistent with the existing defensive pattern in `csvExport.ts`.
- **Rating-request notification moved to shipment.** `rating_request` previously fired from the Stripe webhook on payment completion, but server-side eligibility (`checkSaleFeedbackEligibility`) requires `shipped_at`. Buyers were prompted but found no feedback UI. `/api/auctions/[id]/mark-shipped` now fires `rating_request` for both buyer and seller at the moment the button actually becomes visible; the Stripe webhook emission was removed.
- **Feedback eligibility re-fetch on submit.** `useFeedbackEligibility` now accepts a `refreshKey` arg; callers in `ListingDetailModal` + `AuctionDetailModal` pass `${shippedAt}:${feedbackRefreshTick}` so the hook re-queries when `shippedAt` flips and again after `LeaveFeedbackButton.onFeedbackSubmitted` bumps the tick. UI swaps to "Feedback submitted on …" without a hard refresh.
- **Active Bids tab fix.** `/api/transactions?type=bids` had its Supabase select referencing column `amount`; the real column is `bid_amount`. Single-character rename in the select + matching `row.bid_amount` access site fixed the 500.
- **Outbid email — `yourMaxBid` line.** `BidActivityEmailData.yourMaxBid` field was already declared but the template never rendered it. HTML and text variants now conditionally render "Your max bid: $X"; wired from `currentWinningBid.max_bid` at the `placeBid` call site so bidders know if their proxy is still in the running.
- **Mobile auction/Buy-Now modal cover caps.** `AuctionDetailModal` cover image capped at `max-h-[35vh]` on mobile (desktop `md:max-h-[70vh]` unchanged); `ListingDetailModal` capped at `max-h-[40vh]` on mobile. Fixes cover image dominating the viewport and leaving a sliver for bid details.
- **Purchase confirmation email copy.** "The comic has been added to your collection." → "The comic will be added to your collection once the seller marks it as shipped." — matches actual ship-gated ownership-transfer timing.

**Session 39 changes (April 23, 2026) — Second Chance + Strike + Audit + Cron Batching:**
- **Second Chance Offer System** — When auction expires unpaid and runner-up exists, seller gets email + in-app notification with "Offer to runner-up" CTA. Runner-up has 48h to accept at their last actual bid price (not max_bid). No cascade. New table `second_chance_offers` + RLS, new routes (`/api/auctions/[id]/second-chance`, `/api/second-chance-offers`, `/api/second-chance-offers/[id]`), new components (`SecondChanceOfferButton`, `SecondChanceInboxCard`), cron pass `expireSecondChanceOffers`, 5 new email templates, 7 new notification types. See Feature #22 below.
- **Payment-Miss Strike System** — See Feature #21 below. Inside `expireUnpaidAuctions()`, increments `payment_missed_count`; 1st offense → warning email, 2+ strikes in 90 days → sets `bid_restricted_at`, inserts system-negative reputation rating, emails user + admins. `/api/auctions/[id]/bid` enforces bid restriction.
- **Auction Audit Log** — See Feature #23 below. New table `auction_audit_log` (admin-read RLS), `auction_audit_event_type` enum, `src/lib/auditLog.ts` helper, 17 wire-ups across auction/offer/payment/shipment lifecycle. Admins can now query a complete transaction log for dispute resolution + debugging.
- **Cron Batching** — `src/lib/concurrency.ts` with `mapWithConcurrency(5)`. `sendPaymentReminders` + `expireUnpaidAuctions` refactored: serial race-safe UPDATE → batched Supabase notification insert → Resend `batch.send()` (50 emails/batch). Handles 50+ expirations per tick without timeout or rate-limit issues.

## 12. P2P Trading System
Comics marked `for_trade` → algorithmic matching via `find_trade_matches()` RPC → match quality scoring → trade proposal → accept → ship (with tracking) → confirm receipt → `completeTrade()` swaps `comics.user_id` ownership. Feedback reminders auto-created post-completion.

**Key files:** `src/lib/tradingDb.ts`, `src/app/api/trades/`

---

## 13. Messaging System with Content Moderation
Conversation model (2-party) → content validation → spam/scam filter → block check → Supabase real-time broadcast → email notification (fire-and-forget). Cron-driven AI moderation: Claude analyzes flagged messages → severity scoring → auto-report creation for medium+.

**Key files:** `src/lib/messagingDb.ts`, `src/app/api/messages/`, `src/app/api/cron/moderate-messages/route.ts`

---

## 14. Follow System & Notification Chain
Unidirectional follows with denormalized counts on `profiles`. New listing triggers `notifyFollowersOfNewListing()` → batch notification insert → email dispatch for opted-in users. "Following Only" marketplace filter uses `getFollowingIds()`.

**Key files:** `src/lib/followDb.ts`, `src/app/api/follows/`, `src/components/follows/`

---

## 15. Seller Reputation & Feedback Engine
Binary ratings (positive/negative) per transaction (sale/auction/trade). 7-day edit window, 48-hour seller response window (negative only). Creator Credits for community contributions (key info, cover images). Reputation tiers: Hero (95%+, 5+ reviews), Villain (<50%), Neutral.

**Eligibility rules (Session 37 update):** Both sale and auction buyer eligibility unlock on `shipped_at` (seller-reported tracking). Fallback: 7 days after sale/auction end if seller never marks shipped. Seller eligibility unlocks immediately on ship-or-completed.

**Session 40b/c updates — rating-request timing + live eligibility refresh:**
- `rating_request` notification moved from the Stripe webhook (payment completed) to `/api/auctions/[id]/mark-shipped` so it fires at the same moment server-side eligibility flips true. Both buyer AND seller get a `rating_request` at shipment.
- `useFeedbackEligibility` now accepts a `refreshKey` arg. `ListingDetailModal` + `AuctionDetailModal` pass `${shippedAt}:${feedbackRefreshTick}` — the `shippedAt` half re-queries when shipment status changes; `LeaveFeedbackButton.onFeedbackSubmitted` bumps the tick so submission triggers a fresh query that returns `canLeaveFeedback: false` with `feedbackLeftAt` populated, swapping the UI to "Feedback submitted on …" without a hard refresh.

## 16. Offline-First Architecture (PWA)
Service Worker: network-first for pages, cache-first for static assets. Offline action queue syncs on reconnect via Background Sync API. `useOffline` hook exposes `isOnline`, `pendingActionsCount`, `syncPendingActions()`. Guest collection stored entirely in localStorage.

**Key files:** `public/sw.js`, `src/hooks/useOffline.ts`, `src/lib/offlineCache.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`

---

## 17. ~~Hot Books / Trending Discovery~~ (REMOVED — Session 38)

Feature fully removed April 23, 2026. Deleted: `src/app/hottest-books/*`, `src/app/api/hottest-books/*`, `src/lib/hotBooksData.ts`. DB tables `hot_books`, `hot_books_history`, `hot_books_refresh_log` remain but are no longer read by any code path. Navigation entries pruned from `Navigation.tsx` and `MobileNav.tsx`. Removed because the feature did not align with product vision (collection & community first, marketplace secondary).

---

## 18. Public Collection Sharing
Toggle `is_public` → auto-generate URL slug → `/u/[slug]` renders public profile with collection stats, shared lists, and comics. RLS policies gate visibility. SEO metadata generation. Per-list sharing control via `is_shared` flag.

**Key files:** `src/app/u/[slug]/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/sharing/route.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts` (public profile functions)

---

## 19. Admin Operations Suite
Cover approval queue, barcode review queue, key info moderation, message report review, user management (suspend/grant premium/reset trial), health checks (eBay/storage connectivity), usage monitoring with rate limit alerts. **Session 39 addition:** flagged-users endpoint (`/api/admin/flagged-users`) surfaces users with `bid_restricted_at` set from the Payment-Miss Strike System.

**Key files:** `src/app/api/admin/`, `src/lib/adminAuth.ts`

---

## 20. Email System (Themed Templates)
Resend integration with comic-themed templates (POW!, BAM!, KA-CHING! sound effects). **27+ email types** (was 12+): welcome, trial expiring, offers, listings, messages, feedback reminders, followed seller alerts, auction won/sold/lost, payment received, shipped, rating request, plus Session 38+39 additions (payment_reminder, auction_payment_expired, auction_payment_expired_seller, payment_missed_warning, payment_missed_flagged, 5 Second Chance Offer templates). Cron-driven batch sending with idempotency guards.

**Session 39 additions:**
- **Preference gating** via `NOTIFICATION_CATEGORY_MAP` (`src/lib/notificationPreferences.ts`): 4 categories (Transactional locked / Marketplace / Social / Marketing). `sendNotificationEmail` + `sendNotificationEmailsBatch` check `profiles.email_pref_marketplace`/`email_pref_social`/`email_pref_marketing` before sending, return skipped count. (Schema: migration `20260423_notification_preferences.sql`.)
- **Resend `batch.send()`** used by cron passes — 50 emails/batch, fed via `mapWithConcurrency(5)` from `src/lib/concurrency.ts`. Unlocks 50+ payment expirations per cron tick without rate-limit issues.
- **UI:** per-category toggles at `/settings/notifications` (GET/PATCH on `/api/settings/notifications`), plus 29 unit tests.

**Session 40 copy polish:**
- **Outbid email — max bid line.** Template now conditionally renders "Your max bid: $X" on both HTML + text variants when `BidActivityEmailData.yourMaxBid` is present. Wired from `currentWinningBid.max_bid` at the `placeBid` call site so bidders can tell if their proxy is still in play.
- **Purchase confirmation email copy.** "added to your collection" → "will be added to your collection once the seller marks it as shipped" — matches ship-gated ownership-transfer timing.
- **Site-wide em dash sweep.** ~55 em dashes (U+2014) removed from user-facing copy across 10 files (all email templates HTML + text, FAQ answers, notification titles/messages, seller-onboarding guide, about/terms/settings, SecondChanceInboxCard, comicFacts, refresh-value error string, collection placeholder glyphs). Context-aware replacements: names followed by dash → comma; sentence break → period; gloss → colon; no-space dash → hyphen. ~224 occurrences intentionally skipped in code comments, console args, AI prompts, internal validator reasons, JSDoc, tests, migrations, and markdown docs.

**Key files:** `src/lib/email.ts`, `src/lib/notificationPreferences.ts`, `src/lib/concurrency.ts`, `src/types/notificationPreferences.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/send-trial-reminders/route.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/send-feedback-reminders/route.ts`, `src/app/api/settings/notifications/route.ts`, `src/app/settings/notifications/page.tsx`

## 21. Payment Deadline Enforcement + Payment-Miss Strike System (Sessions 38 + 39)

48-hour payment window enforced automatically from auction end (or Buy Now purchase) through the `/api/cron/process-auctions` pipeline.

**Timeline:**
- `T=0` — auction ends or Buy Now purchase → `payment_deadline` = T+48h
- `T+24h` — `sendPaymentReminders()` cron pass. Conditional UPDATE `WHERE payment_reminder_sent_at IS NULL` (race-safe). Resend `batch.send()` delivers `payment_reminder` templates via `mapWithConcurrency(5)`.
- `T+48h` — `expireUnpaidAuctions()` cron pass. Conditional UPDATE `WHERE payment_expired_at IS NULL`. Sets `status='cancelled'`, `payment_expired_at=NOW()`. Emails `auction_payment_expired` (buyer) + `auction_payment_expired_seller` (seller). Fires Payment-Miss Strike System.
- `T+48h`+ — checkout-time guard on `/api/checkout`: HTTP 400 "payment window has expired" if a late-pay attempt sneaks in.
- `/transactions` — live `<PaymentDeadlineCountdown>` ticks every 60s; neutral >24h, orange ≤24h, red ≤6h, "Expired" at ≤0.

**Payment-Miss Strike System (Session 39):**
- **1st offense:** increment `profiles.payment_missed_count`, set `payment_missed_at`, send `payment_missed_warning` email.
- **2+ strikes in 90 days:** set `profiles.bid_restricted_at`, insert system-generated negative `transaction_feedback` row (idempotent on unique constraint), email `payment_missed_flagged`, notify admins via `/api/admin/flagged-users`.
- **Enforcement:** `/api/auctions/[id]/bid` blocks bid placement when `bid_restricted_at IS NOT NULL`.
- **Audit:** every transition is logged to `auction_audit_log` (see Feature #23).

**Migrations:**
- `20260423_payment_reminder_tracking.sql` — `payment_reminder_sent_at`, `payment_expired_at` columns + partial index (Session 38)
- `20260423_payment_miss_tracking.sql` — 4 profile columns + `user_flagged` audit enum value + `valid_notification_type` CHECK constraint fix (Session 39)

**Key files:** `src/lib/auctionDb.ts` (`sendPaymentReminders()`, `expireUnpaidAuctions()`), `src/lib/concurrency.ts`, `src/lib/email.ts`, `src/app/api/cron/process-auctions/route.ts`, `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts`, `src/app/api/auctions/[id]/bid/route.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/flagged-users/route.ts`, `src/components/PaymentDeadlineCountdown.tsx`, `src/types/auction.ts` (`calculatePaymentDeadline()`, `PAYMENT_REMINDER_WINDOW_HOURS`)

## 22. Second Chance Offer System (Session 39)

Seller-initiated re-offer to the runner-up after an auction expires unpaid.

**Flow:**
1. Auction expires unpaid via `expireUnpaidAuctions()` cron pass. If a runner-up exists, `handleRunnerUpForExpiredAuction()` (`auctionDb.ts:3293`) creates a `second_chance_available` in-app notification and email for the seller with an "Offer to runner-up" CTA. **Idempotent:** if a `second_chance_offers` row already exists for the auction, the function early-returns — no duplicate notification, safe for cron re-runs.
2. Seller clicks CTA in `SecondChanceOfferButton` → `POST /api/auctions/[id]/second-chance` → creates `second_chance_offers` row with `status='pending'`, `expires_at = NOW() + 48h`.
3. Runner-up is notified (`second_chance_offered` email + in-app), sees the offer in `SecondChanceInboxCard` with 48h countdown.
4. **Price = runner-up's last actual bid price** (not their `max_bid`).
5. Accept → `POST /api/second-chance-offers/[id]` (`action: "accept"`) → re-opens the auction row (see "Auction row transitions" below) → buyer flows into the standard `/api/checkout` path → same payment deadline enforcement and Stripe Connect payout as a normal won auction. Mark-shipped + feedback eligibility flows are **identical to a normal win** — no special casing downstream.
6. Decline or ignore → `expireSecondChanceOffers()` cron pass flips unanswered offers to `status='expired'` at the 48h mark. **No cascade** — the offer simply ends; it does NOT fall to 3rd place (tracked as a Low-priority BACKLOG enhancement).

**Runner-up selection rule** (`auctionDb.ts:3308-3325`): all bids for the auction ordered `bid_amount DESC, created_at ASC`. First row's `bidder_id` is the winner. Runner-up = the first subsequent row whose `bidder_id !== winner.bidder_id`. Ties in `bid_amount` are broken by earliest `created_at`. If there are fewer than 2 distinct bidders, no offer is created.

**Auction row transitions on accept** (`auctionDb.ts:3723-3767`): conditional UPDATE on `second_chance_offers` (race-safe — requires `status='pending' AND expires_at > NOW()`), then auction row patched with `status='ended'`, `winner_id = runnerUp`, `winning_bid = offer_price`, `payment_status='pending'`, `payment_deadline = NOW() + 48h`, `payment_expired_at = NULL`. Acceptance + auction re-open are **not transactional** — if the auction re-open fails, the offer stays accepted and the error is logged for admin follow-up.

**Infrastructure:**
- New table `second_chance_offers` with RLS (migration `20260423_second_chance_offers.sql`)
- **Columns:** `id`, `auction_id` (FK auctions), `runner_up_profile_id` (FK profiles — **not** `recipient_profile_id`), `offer_price` (numeric), `status` (`pending | accepted | declined | expired`), `expires_at`, `accepted_at`, `declined_at`, `created_at`
- New routes: `POST /api/auctions/[id]/second-chance` (seller creates), `GET /api/second-chance-offers` (runner-up's pending inbox), `POST/PATCH /api/second-chance-offers/[id]` (runner-up accepts/declines)
- New cron pass `expireSecondChanceOffers` added to `/api/cron/process-auctions` pipeline
- **5 email templates + 5 notification types** — `second_chance_available` (seller), `second_chance_offered` (runner-up), `second_chance_accepted` (seller), `second_chance_declined` (seller), `second_chance_expired` (seller). Types enumerated in `src/types/auction.ts:39-43`.
- **Audit events** emitted via `logAuctionAuditEvent`: `offer_accepted` + `offer_rejected` (both with `eventData.kind: "second_chance"` discriminator) on runner-up action; `second_chance_sent`, `second_chance_accepted`, `second_chance_expired` enum values are declared in `auction_audit_event_type` and wired at corresponding state transitions.
- Components: `src/components/auction/SecondChanceOfferButton.tsx`, `src/components/auction/SecondChanceInboxCard.tsx`

**Key files:** `src/lib/auctionDb.ts`, `src/types/auction.ts`, `src/app/api/auctions/[id]/second-chance/route.ts`, `src/app/api/second-chance-offers/route.ts`, `src/app/api/second-chance-offers/[id]/route.ts`, `src/components/auction/SecondChanceOfferButton.tsx`, `src/components/auction/SecondChanceInboxCard.tsx`

## 23. Auction Audit Log (Session 39)

Complete state-transition log for every auction/offer/payment/shipment event. Enables admin dispute resolution + debugging.

- **Table:** `auction_audit_log` (admin-read RLS, service-role insert). Migration: `20260423_auction_audit_log.sql`.
- **Enum:** `auction_audit_event_type` with 20+ events: `auction_created`, `bid_placed`, `auction_ended`, `buy_now_purchased`, `payment_received`, `payment_reminder_sent`, `payment_expired`, `second_chance_sent`, `second_chance_accepted`, `second_chance_expired`, `shipped`, `offer_sent`, `offer_accepted`, `offer_declined`, `user_flagged`, etc.
- **Helper:** `src/lib/auditLog.ts` — fire-and-forget single + batch variants; does NOT block critical path on failure.
- **Wire-ups:** 17 call sites across `src/lib/auctionDb.ts`, `src/app/api/auctions/[id]/mark-shipped/route.ts`, and `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`.
- **Tests:** 15 unit tests.

**Key files:** `src/lib/auditLog.ts`, `src/app/api/auctions/[id]/mark-shipped/route.ts`, `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260423_auction_audit_log.sql`

## 24. Input Validation Layer — Zod (Session 39)

All API routes (~81 as of Session 45b, after `quick-lookup` was retired alongside Comic Vine) validate input via a shared helper before any business logic runs.

- **Helper:** `src/lib/validation.ts` — `validateBody(request, schema)`, `validateQuery(request, schema)`, `validateParams(params, schema)`, plus reusable field schemas (`schemas.uuid` / `email` / `url` / `trimmedString` / `positiveInt` / `nonNegativeNumber`)
- **Standardized error:** HTTP 400 with `{error: "Validation failed", details: [{field, issue}]}`
- **`.strict()` support** used on `settings/*` routes to reject unknown fields
- **Scope:**
  - Marketplace + money (31 routes): auctions, offers, listings, checkout, billing, connect, trades, transactions, feedback, reputation
  - User + social + admin (32 routes): username, users, sellers, follows, messages, notifications, settings, age-verification, waitlist, email-capture, watchlist, sharing, location, admin/*
  - Content + scan + lookup: analyze, barcode-lookup, cert-lookup, comic-lookup, import-lookup, con-mode-lookup, key-hunt, cover-*, comics, ebay-prices, titles (`quick-lookup` removed in Session 45b — see Section 8 / Comic Vine retirement)
- **Dependency:** adds `zod` as a runtime dep

**Key files:** `src/lib/validation.ts`, `package.json` (zod), `src/app/api/**/*.ts` (~81 routes instrumented after Session 45b's `quick-lookup` removal)

## 25. Clerk ↔ Supabase Username & Profile Sync (Sessions 38 + 39)

Bidirectional sync so that Clerk and Supabase `profiles` never drift.

**Inbound (Clerk → Supabase)** — `/api/webhooks/clerk` on `user.created` and `user.updated`:
- Upserts `profiles` row with email + username (sanitized via `sanitizeUsername()` against Supabase's `^[a-z0-9_]{3,20}$` regex) + `first_name` + `last_name` + derived `display_name` (via `buildDisplayName()`)
- Sanitizer ensures invalid usernames (e.g. with dashes, which Clerk allows) don't kill the entire upsert — the rest of the fields still land

**Outbound (Supabase → Clerk)** — `/api/username` sync-on-write (Session 39):
- POST and DELETE now call the Clerk Backend API after successful Supabase update
- Graceful degradation: Clerk errors are logged but don't fail the request (Supabase remains source of truth)

**Known drift point:** Clerk dashboard allows dashes in usernames; Supabase's CHECK constraint doesn't. Still-open BACKLOG item to align Clerk's username rules so users get a friendly error at signup.

**Key files:** `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` (`sanitizeUsername()`, `buildDisplayName()`), `src/app/api/username/route.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts` (`getOrCreateProfile()` self-heals email)

## 26. Sales Page — Partial Gating for Free Tier (Session 40d/e)

The `/sales` page is visible to every user regardless of tier; only the aggregate stats UI is paywalled.

- **Always visible:** Sales list + per-row detail (Comic, Sale Price, Date). Free users can see their entire sold-books history.
- **Gated on `features.fullStats`:**
  - 3 Summary Cards at the top (Total Sales / Total Profit / Avg. Profit) — wrapped in a `relative` container with `filter blur-sm pointer-events-none select-none` and an absolutely positioned upgrade CTA overlay ("Unlock your Sales Stats" / "Start 7-Day Free Trial" / "View Pricing").
  - Cost `<th>`/`<td>` and Profit `<th>`/`<td>` in the desktop table + mobile detail panel — conditionally rendered behind `hasStatsAccess`.
  - Empty-state copy drops the "with profit tracking" phrase for free users.
- **Write path is tier-agnostic.** `markComicAsSold` in `src/lib/db.ts` always writes `purchase_price`, `sale_price`, and `profit` into the `sales` table. Free users' sale data is fully preserved → upgrading surfaces existing data retroactively. Overlay copy explicitly tells users "Your sale data is still being saved."

**Key files:** `src/app/sales/page.tsx`, `src/lib/db.ts` (`markComicAsSold`)

## 27. Ask the Professor FAQ Modal (Session 40b/c)

Site-wide FAQ modal surfaced from `Navigation.tsx` (desktop) and `AskProfessor.tsx` (mobile).

- **Session 40b content addition:** "What happens after I buy a comic?" entry explains the payment → seller notified → ship → comic added to collection → feedback window flow. Sets expectations for the ship-gated ownership transfer and answers the "why doesn't it show up yet?" question in plain English.
- **Session 40c UX polish:**
  - **Body scroll lock.** `useEffect` in `Navigation.tsx` sets `document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"` while `showProfessor` is true, with cleanup restoring the previous value. Prevents the underlying page from scrolling once the user reaches the end of the FAQ list.
  - **Internal link → close modal.** Delegated click handler on the FAQ list container closes the modal (`setShowProfessor(false)`) when the click target is inside an `<a>`. Works for the existing Seller Onboarding link and any future FAQ links without per-link wiring.

**Key files:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx`, `src/components/AskProfessor.tsx`

## 28. Notifications Inbox (Session 42d, Apr 27 2026)

Full-page `/notifications` view that complements the bell-dropdown preview. Mobile-first — the bell line-clamps message bodies and offers no escape route; the inbox renders full text with infinite scroll, per-row dismiss, and offline cache hydration. Designed to be the deep-link destination for Capacitor iOS push notifications once the native app ships.

**Routing & deep-link contract:**
- `getNotificationDeepLink(notification)` is the single source of truth across bell, inbox, email links, and the future Capacitor `PushNotifications` listener. When the notification carries an `auction_id` it links to `/shop?listing=<id>` (or `…&leave-feedback=true` for `rating_request`). When it doesn't (system-only types), it links to `/notifications?focus=<id>`.
- The inbox reads `?focus=<id>` on mount and either scrolls/flash-highlights the row in the current page, or fetches it via `GET /api/notifications/:id` to confirm existence. On 404 (e.g., the row was pruned) it surfaces a toast and `router.replace`s the URL to clear the param so a remount doesn't re-trigger.

**Pagination:**
- Composite cursor `(created_at, id)` ordered DESC. Single-key cursors break under the cron's batch inserts (`processEndedAuctions`, `sendPaymentReminders`, `notifyFollowersOfNewListing`) which all share `now()` to the microsecond.
- Wire format: base64 of `${createdAt}|${id}`, URL-safe (`+` → `-`, `/` → `_`, no padding).
- Server-side `limit` capped at `NOTIFICATIONS_PAGE_LIMIT_MAX = 100`.
- SQL builder uses PostgREST `.or("created_at.lt.X,and(created_at.eq.X,id.lt.Y)")` because the JS client doesn't natively express row-tuple `<`.

**Auto-cleanup:**
- `pruneOldNotifications()` cron pass (every 5 min via Netlify scheduled function): hard-deletes rows where `read_at < NOW() - 30d` AND rows where `is_read = false AND created_at < NOW() - 90d`. Returns counts; cron logs them.
- Trade-off documented: email links pointing at `/notifications?focus=<id>` go 404-feeling after 30 days. Most email links target the underlying auction directly via `getNotificationDeepLink`, so this is a corner case for system-only types only.

**Schema (migration `20260427_notifications_inbox.sql`):**
- `read_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` (drives 30-day prune; backfilled to `created_at` for already-read rows)
- `idx_notifications_user_created (user_id, created_at DESC)` — covers the cursor hot path
- `idx_notifications_cleanup (read_at) WHERE read_at IS NOT NULL` — bounded prune index
- New RLS DELETE policy `notifications_delete_policy USING (user_id = current_profile_id())` (defense-in-depth; the API uses `supabaseAdmin` so it bypasses RLS, but the policy stops anyone refactoring to the anon client)

**Security:**
- `markNotificationRead(notificationId, userId)` is now owner-scoped — a pre-existing IDOR (any auth'd user could mark anyone else's notification read by guessing UUIDs) was discovered in Round 2 of the deep dive and patched as part of this work.
- `markAllNotificationsRead(userId, asOf?)` clamps to `created_at <= asOf` so notifications arriving mid-flight aren't silently swept; also narrows by `read_at IS NULL` for idempotent re-runs.
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` does atomic `.eq("id", id).eq("user_id", profile.id)`, suspension check, and rejects `NON_DELETABLE_NOTIFICATION_TYPES` (`payment_missed_warning`, `payment_missed_flagged`, `auction_payment_expired`, `auction_payment_expired_seller`) — moderation/safety evidence the user shouldn't be able to erase.
- `GET /api/notifications/:id` returns 404 (not 403) on owner mismatch to avoid leaking existence.

**Bell behavior** (reversed from the original plan after Round 1's "liar badge" feedback):
- Shows ALL notifications. System-only types (no `auction_id`) render dimmed + non-clickable with "View in inbox for details" hint. Badge count = ALL unread (honest math).
- Footer adds "View all notifications →" link to `/notifications`.

**Offline-first cache:**
- `notificationsCache.ts` stores last successful inbox response in localStorage, profile-namespaced (`cc_notifications_inbox_<profileId>`), version-tagged (CACHE_VERSION = 1).
- On fetch failure, hydrate from cache + show banner "Showing cached notifications. Tap to refresh →". Distinguishes offline-empty from true-empty so a user tapping a push from lock-screen doesn't see "You're all caught up" when their inbox actually has content.
- Cleared on Clerk sign-out via `useEffect` watching `userId`.

**Mobile/Capacitor decisions:**
- No custom pull-to-refresh in v1 — iOS WKWebView's native bounce conflicts with JS-level pull events. Show "Last updated Xm ago — tap to refresh" pill instead. Defer to `@capacitor/pull-to-refresh` when native app ships.
- 44×44pt transparent padding around the per-row X dismiss button + `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent fat-finger collision with the row tap.
- Cards: min-height 88px, `line-clamp-3` on the message — long messages don't break the Lichtenstein bordered card layout.

**Tests:** 20 new unit tests across `notificationCursor.test.ts` and `notificationLinks.test.ts`. Cursor tests cover encode/decode roundtrip + URL-safety + malformed-input tolerance + the PostgREST `.or()` builder. Link tests cover deep-link mapping + clickability predicate + `NON_DELETABLE_TYPES` membership matrix.

**Three rounds of deep-dive review** before code: 3 Critical / 8 High / 9 Medium / 6 Low (R1) → 1 Critical / 2 High / 3 Medium (R2) → PASS with 2 minor follow-ups (R3, both captured for post-launch BACKLOG). Findings logged to `docs/superpowers/deep-dive-learnings.md`.
