# Collectors Chest - Comprehensive Evaluation

> Launch readiness scorecard. See `BACKLOG.md` for open work items and `DEV_LOG.md` for session history.

*Last Updated: May 27, 2026 (Session 47)*

---

## Executive Summary

Collectors Chest is a comic book collection tracking app with AI-powered cover recognition and a new auction marketplace feature. The app is currently in **Private Beta** with public registration disabled.

**Overall Score: 9.6/10** (Session 46 (May 9, 2026) shipped + deployed two fixes: (1) **Scan Cover Persistence** — signed-in users' FAB scan photos now persist via the new `comic-covers` Supabase bucket, eliminating the universal "?" placeholder regression for all signed-in users; (2) **3-Tier Variant Name Resolver** — new `src/lib/variantResolver.ts` with catalog → AI → derived tiers, wired into `/api/analyze`, with admin-approval guard for community variant names and a new schema field on `barcode_catalog`. Important production gap surfaced during testing: the resolver requires the AI to extract a full 17-digit barcode (12-digit UPC + 5-digit add-on), but production scans only capture 12 digits, so the resolver doesn't fire in prod yet — tracked in BACKLOG as "Variant Detection — Two-Pass High-Res Barcode OCR (Option C3)" and is the top priority for next session. 850/850 tests passing.)

**Current Status: PRIVATE BETA**
- Site is live at collectors-chest.com
- Public registration is DISABLED (waitlist only)
- Existing accounts (developer) still work
- Guests can use 5 free scans (sign up for 10/month)

## 0. Private Beta Checklist (Before Opening Registration)

> **Do NOT open registration until these items are complete**

### Critical (Must Have)

✅ All critical items complete except:

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Stripe Connect for seller payouts | ✅ Live mode enabled Apr 21, 2026 - ready for real-money test | Enable Connect in Stripe dashboard, configure Express accounts |

### High Priority

✅ Most high-priority items complete. Remaining:

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Test payment flows end-to-end | ✅ Validated Apr 22, 2026 | Auction + Buy Now E2E in localhost/sandbox. Real-money test still pending after deploy. |
| Test Stripe Connect seller flow | ⚠️ Test mode validated end-to-end Apr 21–22, 2026 — real-money test pending | Seller onboarding, sandbox purchase, fee split, auction + Buy Now paths all validated. Real payout to seller bank still pending. |
| Generate QR code for /join/trial | ✅ Handed off | Third party vendor producing the QR + business cards |
| Database backup strategy | ⚠️ Planned (Post-Launch) | Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/mo) when warranted by user growth — not a launch blocker. Interim: manual pg_dump before destructive migrations. See BACKLOG Pending Enhancements. |

### Medium Priority

_(No open Medium items. Hottest Books was removed from scope Apr 22, 2026 — see BACKLOG "Remove Hottest Books Feature" for the code cleanup task.)_

---

## 1. Code Quality & Technical Debt

**Score: 9.5/10** (Session 46 added `src/lib/variantResolver.ts` (3-tier catalog → AI → derived) + signed-in cover-persistence helpers (`src/lib/uploadCoverImage.ts`, `/api/comics/upload-cover`); +21 net new tests (variantResolver). TypeScript clean, ESLint 0 errors / 116 pre-existing warnings, build clean, npm audit clean, no circular deps. Knip surfaces 14 unused exported types, 1 new this session (`VariantSource` from variantResolver — not externally consumed yet, OK to defer). 850/850 tests passing.)

### Issues Status

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Test suite | 🟢 Good | **850 tests passing** (May 9, 2026) |
| ESLint config | 🟢 Fixed | Working with Next.js defaults |
| Viewport/themeColor metadata | 🟢 Fixed | Migrated to `export const viewport` |
| Stripe webhook config export | 🟢 Fixed | Deprecated config removed |
| TypeScript compilation | 🟢 Passing | Clean |
| Production build | 🟢 Passing | Clean |
| Sentry error tracking | 🟢 Added | Production-ready |
| PostHog analytics | 🟢 Added | Tracking enabled |
| API input validation | 🟢 Complete | **Zod validation sweep across 82 routes** (Apr 23, 2026) — marketplace, user/social/admin, content/scan/lookup. Shared `src/lib/validation.ts` helper with `validateBody`/`validateQuery`/`validateParams` + standardized `{error, details:[{field, issue}]}` response shape |

### Remaining Work

1. **Expand test coverage** - Hook coverage, component coverage for auction flows

---

## 2. Security Posture

**Score: 9.6/10** (Session 44 closed an RLS-anon-read bug in `getAuctionSecondChanceState` (anon `supabase` client couldn't read `second_chance_offers` because RLS policies key off Supabase JWT claims that Clerk-authed sessions don't provide → switched to `supabaseAdmin`). Production-affecting marketplace correctness bug, security-adjacent. Reinforces the codebase pattern: Clerk-authed server reads of RLS-protected tables must use the admin client. No new vulns introduced.)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| RLS policies (core tables) | ✅ Good | Production-ready |
| RLS policies (auction tables) | ✅ Good | Properly configured |
| CCPA deletion webhook | ✅ Good | Clerk webhook exists |
| API authentication | ✅ Good | Clerk auth on protected routes |
| Stripe webhook verification | ✅ Good | Signature validation |
| Rate limiting | ✅ Added | Upstash rate limiting on AI & bid routes |
| npm audit (dependencies) | ✅ Clean | 0 vulnerabilities |
| Input validation | ✅ Complete | **Zod schema validation on 82 API routes** (Apr 23, 2026) — UUID format, enum values, length caps, nested shapes. HTTP 400 with standardized `{error, details}` shape on invalid input |
| Image upload size caps | ✅ Complete | 10MB cap enforced on `/api/analyze` + `/api/messages/upload-image` via `src/lib/uploadLimits.ts` (added Apr 23, 2026) |
| CAPTCHA on guest scans | ✅ Complete | **hCaptcha on scans 4–5** (added Session 38/39). Pro trial through May 7, 2026 → auto-downgrades to free tier (1M req/mo) |
| Audit logging | ✅ Complete | **`auction_audit_log` table** with 20 event types + 17 lifecycle wire-ups (Apr 23, 2026). Admin-only RLS. Covers auction/offer/payment/shipment transitions + Stripe webhook |
| Payment-miss strike system | ✅ Complete | First-offense warning email, 2-strikes-in-90-days triggers bid restriction + reputation hit (Apr 23, 2026) — partial fraud mitigation |
| Trade matches IDOR | ✅ Closed Apr 28, 2026 | `/api/trades/matches/[matchId]` PATCH was updating by row id only; now scoped by `user_a_id`/`user_b_id` predicate (Session 43 RLS-bypass audit) |
| Notifications GET rate limit | ✅ Added Apr 28, 2026 | `GET /api/notifications/:id` now rate-limited — Capacitor retry-storm guard (Session 43) |
| Second Chance Offer RLS read | ✅ Closed May 5, 2026 | `getAuctionSecondChanceState` was using anon Supabase client to read `second_chance_offers` (RLS keys off Supabase JWT — Clerk-authed sessions don't provide it). Switched to `supabaseAdmin` (Session 44). Reinforces "Clerk-authed server reads of RLS tables = admin client" pattern. |
| CSRF protection | ⚠️ Implicit | Next.js provides some protection |
| Middleware protection | ⚠️ Minimal | Few routes marked as protected |
| Bid fraud detection | ⚠️ Partial | Strike system covers payment-miss pattern; pattern-based bid anomaly detection is post-launch — see BACKLOG |

### Security Recommendations

Remaining items tracked in BACKLOG.md:
- Advanced bidding fraud detection (pattern-based)
- Middleware protection expansion
- Explicit CSRF tokens on sensitive mutations

---

## 3. Auction Feature Evaluation

**Score: 9.7/10** (up from 9.6/10 — Session 44 closed the production-affecting Second Chance "Offer to Runner-up" button RLS-anon-read bug; the seller CTA now actually renders for sellers whose winners didn't pay, completing the documented Session 42 wiring.)

### What's Working Well
- eBay-style proxy bidding system
- Seller reputation with positive/negative ratings
- Watchlist functionality
- Payment integration via Stripe
- In-app notifications system
- Cron job for processing ended auctions
- Good database schema with RLS
- **Buy Now fixed-price listings** ✅ PROD-validated end-to-end Apr 23, 2026 (Session 40a hotfix resolved Stripe 2048-char image URL cap; full flow — checkout, payment, ship, ownership transfer, emails — verified in 40b)
- **Stripe Connect fee split** ✅ Validated end-to-end (Apr 21, 2026) — `transfer.created` webhook firing correctly
- **Payment deadline enforcement** ✅ Complete — checkout-time deadline guard, T-24h reminder cron, expire-unpaid-auctions cron, live countdown UI (Sessions 38 + 39)
- **Second Chance Offer** ✅ Complete — seller-initiated 48h offer to runner-up when winner doesn't pay (Session 39); seller CTA now wired into `AuctionDetailModal` + Phase 3 cancellation email mutex preventing the contradictory "cancelled, relist ready" email from firing alongside (Session 42); confirm-dialog "Send Offer" button moved blue → green for clarity (Session 42b); RLS-anon-read bug fixed May 5, 2026 — `getAuctionSecondChanceState` now uses `supabaseAdmin`, restoring the "Offer to Runner-up" button render in production (Session 44)
- **Notifications Inbox v1** ✅ Complete — full `/notifications` page (Session 42d), infinite scroll + per-row dismiss + Mark All Read + offline cache + 30/90-day auto-prune cron + Capacitor-ready deep-link contract. Pre-existing `markNotificationRead` IDOR patched in same commit. Dedicated `shipped` notification type + Truck icon.
- **Marketplace Fee Floor** ✅ Complete — $0.75 minimum platform fee on every sale closes the sub-$6 platform-loss zone (free-tier break-even was $5.88, premium was $14.29). Above $9.38 (8%) / $15.00 (5%) the floor is invisible. Documented in pricing FAQ + Navigation Ask the Professor + Terms 4.5 + TECHNICAL_FEATURES.md Feature #11.
- **Payment-Miss Strike System** ✅ Complete — warn on 1st offense, bid restriction on 2 strikes within 90 days (Session 39)
- **Shipping tracking (Option A)** ✅ Mark-as-shipped with carrier + tracking number, fires buyer notification (Session 37)
- **Auction audit log** ✅ Complete — 20 event types covering full lifecycle (Session 39)
- **Feedback eligibility timing** ✅ Fixed Apr 23, 2026 — `rating_request` now fires at shipment (not payment) + `useFeedbackEligibility` re-queries on shipped/submit so button renders/hides correctly (Session 40b/40c)
- **Outbid email content** ✅ Fixed Apr 23, 2026 — "Your max bid: $X" line now rendered (Session 40b)
- **Active Bids tab** ✅ Fixed Apr 23, 2026 — `bid_amount` column fix resolved 500 on `/transactions?tab=bids` (Session 40d)

### Issues & Gaps

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|
| No dispute resolution | 🟡 Medium | Buyer protection — tracked in BACKLOG |
| Auction sniping protection | 🟡 Medium | No auto-extend on last-minute bids — tracked in BACKLOG |
| Shipping tracking Option B | 🟡 Medium | EasyPost integration + 10-day auto-refund — deferred to dedicated session, see BACKLOG |

## 4. User Experience & Onboarding

**Score: 8.8/10** (up from 8.7/10 — Session 47 PROD-validated the Session 46 cover-persistence pipeline end-to-end on iPhone + Android for the first time (May 27, 2026); confirmed FAB scan photos persist to the `comic-covers` Supabase bucket and render on My Collection cards instead of the "?" placeholder. Session 47 also resolved a cluster of mobile collection-UI bugs — squished detail-modal cover thumbnail, two-line "Add Book" button, blank/cut-off grid covers on iOS Safari first paint, overlapping multi-select header, action bar hidden behind the floating nav, and the iOS double-tap checkbox. Session 46 had fixed the production-affecting "?" placeholder bug for ALL signed-in users (FAB scan photos now persist via `/api/comics/upload-cover` and `src/lib/uploadCoverImage.ts`); Variant Name resolver also shipped but stays blocked by a 12-vs-17-digit barcode OCR gap in production — see BACKLOG "Variant Detection — Two-Pass High-Res Barcode OCR (Option C3)".)

### Guest Experience Flow
1. Land on home page → see features & "How It Works"
2. Scan first comic → immediate value visibility
3. Milestone prompts at scans 2, 3, 4 → conversion nudges
4. Hit limit at 5 → sign-up wall (free account gets 10/month)

### What's Working
- Clear value proposition on homepage
- Progressive milestone prompts with benefits
- Well-designed SignUpPromptModal
- Guest scan count visible

### Gaps

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Email capture | ✅ Done | Bonus scans for email at limit |
| No re-engagement | ❌ Missing | Can't recover churned guests |
| No social proof | ⚠️ Partial | No reviews/testimonials |
| No demo mode | ❌ Missing | Can't explore without scanning |

### Recommendations
1. **Email capture before wall** - Offer "save progress" option
2. **Add Resend integration** - Email capture and drip campaigns
3. **Demo collection** - Let users explore with sample data
4. **Add testimonials** - Social proof on homepage

## 6. Operating Costs & Efficiency

**Score: 8/10** (up from 7/10)

### Current Cost Structure

| Service | Tier | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|--------------|-------|
| Anthropic API | Pay-per-use | Variable | ~$0.015 per scan (Claude Haiku); Session 46 added small Tier-2 AI variant-name lookup on barcode-catalog miss — incremental cost negligible (only fires on cache miss when full 17-digit barcode is present, which is rare today pending OCR fix) |
| Supabase | Free | $0 | 500MB DB, 1GB storage |
| Clerk | Free | $0 | Up to 10K MAU |
| Netlify | Personal Plan | $9.54 | Hosting + domain + DNS (billed 13th) |
| Stripe | Standard | 2.9% + $0.30 | Per transaction |
| eBay API | Free | $0 | Rate limited |
| Upstash Redis | Free | $0 | 10K commands/day |
| Sentry | Free | $0 | 5K errors/month |
| PostHog | Free | $0 | 1M events/month |
| hCaptcha | Pro trial → Free | $0 | Trial through May 7, 2026; then free tier (1M req/mo) |
| Resend | Free | $0 | 3K emails/mo |

### Cost Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| AI costs scale with users | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Redis caching implemented |
| Supabase limits | 🟡 Medium | Monitor usage, upgrade path ready |
| Netlify build minutes | 🟡 Medium | Strategic batching |
| eBay rate limits | 🟡 Medium | AI fallback in place |

### Recommendations
1. **Strategic deploys** - Batch changes, use preview for testing
2. **Pre-populate database** - Cache top 5K comics to reduce AI calls

## 7. Mobile Experience

**Score: 9.1/10** (up from 9.0/10 — Session 47 cleared a batch of mobile collection-UI bugs device-validated on iPhone + Android: detail-modal cover thumbnail no longer squished (bad `h-30` class), "Add Book" button no longer wraps to two lines on iOS, grid covers no longer blank/cut-off on iOS Safari first paint, multi-select header no longer overlaps Cancel, the multi-select action bar is no longer hidden behind the floating bottom nav, and the iOS two-tap checkbox is fixed globally via Tailwind `hoverOnlyWhenSupported`. Cover-persistence scan flow also confirmed working on both phones for the first time.)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| PWA installable | ✅ |
| Offline Key Hunt | ✅ |
| Responsive design | ✅ Collection-page mobile layout bugs (cover thumbnail, Add Book button, grid first-paint, multi-select header/action bar) fixed + device-validated iPhone + Android May 27, 2026 (Session 47) |
| Mobile navigation | ✅ Floating bottom nav now hides during multi-select so the action bar isn't obscured (Session 47) |
| Camera scanning | ✅ |
| Touch interactions | ✅ iOS sticky-hover double-tap on checkboxes fixed globally via Tailwind `hoverOnlyWhenSupported` (Session 47) |
| Mobile auction/listing modal layout | ✅ Fixed Apr 23, 2026 (Session 40a) |

## 10. Risk Assessment

### Mitigated Risks ✅
| Risk | Previous | Current |
|------|----------|---------|
| Price credibility | 🔴 Critical | 🟢 Low (eBay API) |
| No competitive moat | 🔴 Critical | 🟢 Low (AI + Auctions + Buy Now) |
| Unsustainable AI costs | 🔴 Critical | 🟢 Low (Redis caching) |
| Security vulnerabilities | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low (RLS + rate limiting) |
| No marketplace | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low (Auctions + Buy Now) |
| No error tracking | 🔴 High | 🟢 Low (Sentry added) |
| No analytics | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low (PostHog added) |

### Active Risks ⚠️
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Single AI provider dependency | 🟢 Low | Self-healing model pipeline auto-updates deprecated models. MODEL_PRIMARY on Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) pre-empting June 15, 2026 Sonnet 4 retirement. OpenAI + Gemini fallbacks available. |
| Limited deploys | 🟡 Medium | Strategic batching |
| Auction fraud potential | 🟢 Low | **Mitigated Apr 23, 2026**: audit log (20 event types), payment-miss strike system (warn + flag), Zod input validation on 82 routes, hCaptcha on guest scans. Pattern-based bid anomaly detection remains post-launch — see BACKLOG |
| Input validation gaps | 🟢 Low | **Mitigated Apr 23, 2026**: Zod validation sweep closed; remaining risk is basic CSRF + middleware expansion — see BACKLOG |
| RLS-anon-read pattern (Clerk-authed reads vs Supabase RLS) | 🟢 Low | Surfaced May 5, 2026 via Second Chance bug — Clerk-authed server reads of RLS-protected tables must use `supabaseAdmin`. Codebase pattern now reinforced; future occurrences should be caught in review. Broader audit of similar paths tracked in BACKLOG. |
